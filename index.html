			<p> <a name = "main"> </a>The year 2017 has been a year that has brough about may changes and one in which I had more downs and at the same time more ups than any other year. It all began when in December of 2016 when I moved back to the United States after spending over five years in my native country of Trinidad '&' Tobago. I would then move to Clearwater for my son to attend school at the "National Aviation Academy" With no onsite housing we had to make some tough choices to accomidate both our dream for a better tomorrow. and the adventures along the way make for an unforgetable year. </p>

			<h1>A Crazy Adventure</h1>
			<img src="images/skydiving.jpeg" alt="skydiving">
			<p><a name = "crazy"> </a>The year would start by my living in my mother's car for about four months as my son Christopher and I looked for a place to call home.  School for him had already begun and having been a home schooling mother for the past seven years, finances were none existant, but we had to do something different in order to make things work out and this was it. Along the way the windshield would shatter making the car unsafe to drive...it would take two week before we were able to get it fixed. Each day on the road was a pray and a hope that it did not come in on us for as we drove from point 'A' to 'B' fragments of glass would fall on us.</p>

I would also go back into teaching, and to top it off I was looking for a way to get back into the technology field...that's when I found LaunchCode. </p>
